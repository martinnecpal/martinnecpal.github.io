As part of my role as a university lecturer, I manage classes focused on assembly and manufacturing technology using *Tecnomatix Plant Simulation* software. These classes emphasize the practical application of simulation tools to optimize manufacturing processes and assembly procedures.

To support my students and a broader audience, I have created tutorial videos that demonstrate how to use *Tecnomatix Plant Simulation*. These videos are available on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhlArjTkqa-8cQdzVz-SJvd4C9XmhhdGL), providing step-by-step.

Additionally, I authored a textbook on assembly and manufacturing technology using simulation tools, which is accessible on [GitBook](http://stuba.gitbook.io/montaz). This resource serves as a comprehensive guide, covering theoretical concepts and practical applications.

Feel free to explore these resources to learn more about the tools and methods I use in my teaching and research.
